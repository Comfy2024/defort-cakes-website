                    At Defort cakes and more, we believe that baking is an art, and every pastry tells a story. What
                    sets us apart is our unwavering commitment to quality, creativity, and the personal touch that goes
                    into every bite. Unlike traditional bakeries, we don’t just follow recipes — we craft experiences. Our ingredients are carefully sourced, always fresh, and where possible, locally grown, ensuring
                    that every pastry not only tastes exceptional but also supports sustainable practices. We bake with
                    passion, blending classic techniques with innovative twists to create unique pastries that are as
                    beautiful as they are delicious.

                </p>
                <p>
                    What truly makes us different is our focus on customization. Whether you're planning a special
                    event, a birthday, or just craving something extraordinary, our team works closely with you to
                    design pastries that match your taste and vision. We take pride in making every occasion memorable
                    with treats that feel personal and special.

                    At Defort cakes and more, it’s not just about pastries; it’s about bringing people together with
                    food that sparks joy. Come experience the difference — where every pastry is a masterpiece and every
                    visit feels like a celebration.
